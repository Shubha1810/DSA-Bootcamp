# Selection Sort in Python

## Description

This Python program implements the *Selection Sort* algorithm to sort a list of user-input integers in ascending order.

## Features

- Accepts dynamic array size and elements from the user.
- Validates numeric inputs and positive array length.
- Sorts the array using selection sort logic.

## Sample Input/Output

*Input:*
Enter the Length of Array = 5
Enter elements in the array:
29
10
14
37

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes

- Ideal for learning sorting fundamentals.
- Not suitable for large datasets due to quadratic time complexity.
