# Bubble Sort with Swap Count

## Description

This Python program sorts a user-defined array using the *Bubble Sort* algorithm and counts the number of swaps performed during sorting.

## Features

- Takes user input for array size and elements
- Validates numeric input
- Uses arithmetic operations for swapping without a temp variable
- Counts and displays total swaps

## Input/Output Example

*Input:*
Enter the Length of Array = 5
Enter elements in the array:
5
2
8
1
3

*Output:*
Array = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
Sorted Array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
Count = 5

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)  
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes

- Best for educational use or small arrays.
- For large datasets, consider more efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sor
