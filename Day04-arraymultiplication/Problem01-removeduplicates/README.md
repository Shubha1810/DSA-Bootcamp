# Selection Sort and Duplicate Removal in Python

This is a simple Python script that performs the following operations:

1. Takes input from the user to create an array of integers.
2. Sorts the array using the **Selection Sort** algorithm.
3. Removes duplicate elements from the sorted array.
4. Displays both the sorted array and the array with unique elements.

## Features

- Input validation to ensure only integers are accepted.
- Ensures the array contains more than one element.
- Demonstrates basic implementation of **Selection Sort**.
- Removes duplicates without using Python's built-in `set()` to preserve order.

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Save the file as `selection_sort_unique.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using:
