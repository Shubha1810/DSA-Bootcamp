# Singly Linked List with Middle Node Finder

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Implement a singly linked list in Python with the following functionalities:

- Add a node at the **tail** of the list.
- Display all the elements in the list.
- Find and display the **middle node** of the list in constant time.
- Handle empty lists appropriately.
- Maintain a `count` variable to track the number of nodes efficiently.

The application is menu-driven and runs in a loop, allowing users to add values, view the list, and see the middle node.

## ðŸš€ Features

- `add_tail(data)`: Adds a node at the end of the list.
- `display()`: Displays all elements in the list.
- `mid()`: Finds and displays the value of the middle node.
- Uses a simple command-line interface for interaction.

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the script to a file, for example: `linked_list.py`.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python linked_list.py
