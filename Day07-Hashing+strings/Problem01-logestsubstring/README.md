#  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

##  Description

This Python program takes a string as input and computes the *length of the longest substring* that contains *only unique characters* (i.e., no repetitions).

It does this by:
- Taking input from the user
- Sorting the characters
- Removing duplicates
- Counting the number of unique characters

> Note: This version assumes the input string consists of lowercase letters and considers sorted substrings with unique characters only.

## Features
