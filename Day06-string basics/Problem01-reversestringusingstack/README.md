# Reverse a String Using Stack in Python

This Python script demonstrates how to reverse a string using the **stack data structure** concept. It mimics the LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior of stacks to reverse the order of characters in a given string.

## Features

- Takes a string input from the user.
- Uses a **list as a stack** to store and reverse the string.
- Prints the reversed string as output.

## How It Works

1. The input string is converted into a list (used as a stack).
2. Characters are popped from the stack one-by-one and added to a new string.
3. Since stacks follow **LIFO**, the result is the reversed version of the original string.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python (version 3.x or later) is installed.
2. Save the script as `reverse_string_stack.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
