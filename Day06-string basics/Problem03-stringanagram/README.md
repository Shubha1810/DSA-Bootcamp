# Anagram Checker in Python

This Python script checks whether two input strings are **anagrams** of each other. Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters, just arranged differently (e.g., "listen" and "silent").

## Features

- Accepts two strings from the user.
- Converts both strings to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
- Sorts both strings and compares them.
- Validates that inputs are not empty.
- Returns `True` if strings are anagrams, otherwise `False`.

## How It Works

1. The user enters two strings.
2. Both strings are converted to lowercase and sorted.
3. If the sorted versions are equal, the strings are anagrams.
