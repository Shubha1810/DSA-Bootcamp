# Frequency Counter for Array Elements in Python

This Python script accepts an array of integers from the user and calculates the **frequency of each element** using nested loops and a dictionary.

## Features

- Accepts input from the user with input validation.
- Uses nested loops to manually count how many times each element appears in the array.
- Stores and displays frequencies in a dictionary.
- Emphasizes logic-building without using built-in modules like `collections.Counter`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save this file as `frequency_counter.py`.
