# üóº Tower of Hanoi - Recursive Python Solution

This Python script provides a solution to the classic **Tower of Hanoi** problem using recursion. The goal is to move all disks from a source rod to a destination rod using an auxiliary rod, following specific rules.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

Given **`n` disks** stacked in increasing size on a **source rod (A)**, move them all to a **destination rod (C)** using an **auxiliary rod (B)**, while obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

---

## üí° Approach / Thought Process

This is a **classic recursive problem**.  
The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems:

- Move `n-1` disks from **source** to **auxiliary**.
- Move the largest disk (`n`) from **source** to **destination**.
- Move `n-1` disks from **auxiliary** to **destination**.

This is done recursively until the base case of `n == 1`.

## ‚åõ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric             | Complexity         |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Time Complexity     | O(2‚Åø - 1)           |
| Space Complexity    | O(n) (due to recursion stack) |
